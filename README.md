# ImageNav
This is a small web tool for navigating images and collecting data

Steps to run ImageNav:

- Clone the repo
- Go to the cloned directory
- Run the following commands (I recommend running it in development mode because it makes life easy if you want to change anything within the tool)
  - export FLASK_APP=main.py
  - export FLASK_ENV=development
  - flask run
- then go to the link you get from running those three commands
- Flask by default (if not specified) use port 5000
